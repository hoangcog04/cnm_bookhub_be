/* Order Form Specific Styles - Add to pages/order_form.html via style tag or generic CSS */
/* Since we don't have CSS loader, injecting via JS in render or relying on existing classes.
   Let's assume we can add a <style> block in the HTML for specific granular styles 
   or add to css/table.css / css/layout.css.
   For now, I'll rely on global classes + some specific overrides inline or in this block 
   to be appended.
